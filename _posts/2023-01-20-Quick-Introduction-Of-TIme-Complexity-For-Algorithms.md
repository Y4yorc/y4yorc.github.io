Programming is like a cooking recipe. There's a set of instructions in which, you need to follow to solve an specific problem, or to perform a task. And each task in this case, will conform the whole cooking recipe. 

Wanna make a pizza? You need some ingredients (Which from now, I'm gonna call 'em as objects to be in reference): Cheese, Tomato sauce, Pizza dough, etc. You need to assemble all ingredients and then bake it. But I'll ask u something: Don't u ever took how much time did u last making all that pizza? 

In programming, it works similar, but at the time we are coding, we can figure out why our code is taking so much long time to execute, compile, etc. Or the opposite way: Why our code is running so fast, even before noticing how many code lines we wrote?
