title: The Fizzbuzz Challenge in JavaScript

When we talk about a problem that's very common in an interview, we assume we already know how 
to code and solve it. We can discuss some of the most popular problems, like the fibonacci algorithm, plenty of sorting algorithms, etc. and that's a true thing. 

We surely don't know how many problems are but, I'll explain u (by my words) one problem very popular (and often is memed by the community) that's in the 98% of the times, it'll be a question you need to solve by hand in less than 5 min (well, that's the most accurate number tho). This problem's called: The FizzBuzz. 

This article will be relately short, but I'll explain the problem and how to solve it in JavaScript. I'll start saying that this problem is very simple, but it's a good way to test your logic and your ability to code it in the less time possible. 

I'll not use any GUI tools to explain the algorithm, since it's very easy. The thing is that there's lots of ways to solve this problem and each programmer has his own way to solve it according to his logic, so there's no "the best way" to solve it or, a unique rule to follow and if u don't follow it, u are disordering the time-space continuum and the universe will collapse. lol

Nah, just kidding (or not). Well, let's start. First of all, what is the FizzBuzz problem? This problem consists in a simple algorithm that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but if the number is divisible by 3, it outputs "Fizz" instead of the number, if the number is divisible by 5, it outputs "Buzz" instead of the number and if the number is divisible by 3 and 5 (or 15), it outputs "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
