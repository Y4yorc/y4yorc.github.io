When we talk about a problem that's very common in an interview, we assume we already know how 
to code and solve it. We can discuss some of the most popular problems, like the fibonacci algorithm, plenty of sorting algorithms, etc. and that's a true thing. 

We surely don't know how many problems are but, I'll explain u (by my words) one problem very popular (and often is memed by the community) that's in the 98% of the times, it'll be a question you need to solve by hand in less than 5 min (well, that's the most accurate number tho). This problem's called: The FizzBuzz. 

This article will be relately short.
