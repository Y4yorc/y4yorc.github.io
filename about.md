### Yoooo Folks! I'm Luis De León, best known as Yayo or Elyayoveloz (or Celfeercho too). This is my welcome to my porfolio and feel free to explore it.

I'm from Mexico and I'm currently studying in Tecnológico de Monterrey CEM (Campus Estado de México)
 
I have lots of hobbies, here's a few of 'em:
- Bowling (Firstly it was more for chill, but now I'm taking it more seriously. I use 2-handed style and my current max score is 136, updated to Jan 13 2023)
- Chess (I love playing chess, now I'm playing it more seriously to dominate it. I often play a classical 30+0 but sometimes I play blitz 10+0 and 10+3)
- Drawing and writing 
- I read a lot (Hacking and programming books in a mod, growing and motivational books in an another mod. I like fantasy and historical books too)
- Often I play FPS games (once I played tryharded and got into some tournaments lol). When I have enough time, I play COD Mobile, PUBG Mobile, Critical Ops and CSGO. 
- I can compose some basic Heavy Metal riffs (Fav bands: Iron Maiden, Metallica, Anthrax, Slayer, Overkill, DRI, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, KISS, Dokken, Cinderella, Stratovarius, Rhapsody, 
Skull Fist...) 
- I like to assemble things like legos or bricks. 
- Learn new languages (Currently I speak spanish, english, 2/3 french and some basic italian and german)
- I love cars and motorsport, so when I was little I used to play with scale cars. Now, I collect 'em. 

I'm adding also that, if there's any person who wants some help due of difficult times, here's a user :) I know we all pass through difficult times, but only a few people teach me that those
times are to make us more strong than before, and those people are only a part of your life motivating you to help others. 
 	
### Anyways, I'm studying Computer Engineering, so I love developing things. However, this is what I'm studying and developing right now. 

And I'd say that I discovered developing when I was trying to code a simple BASIC C64 Program on an emulator. That was fantastic to me, because I discovered why computers are so populars since
the 70s. I remember that I coded something like: 
```
10 LET X = 30
20 LET Y = 40
30 PRINT X + Y
RUN
```
For me that was fantastic and obviously, I outputed my first "Hello World" tho. I don't care if I'm 20 yo, that's awesome!. Along my career, I discovered new things I can do with programming 
and eventually I was more deeper in this area. I loved it. I started with CPUs, RAM, ROM, EEPROM memories, etc. Then I moved on into Python, C/C++, some JS stuff, and nowadays I'm still building
my knowledge. Here's what I'm studying right now:
- Backend Developing, low and high-level programming
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Reforce Python, C/C++, JS
- Advanced Algorithms
- Async Programming (Mostly on Python)
- Quantum Computing (Tests on Python for now with qiskit)
- Still not advanced but PHP, Perl and Rust 
- Clouding Environment (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)
- Blockchain and Crypto 

For instance, with this knowledge I'm moving into something bigger, which is the Security. An ethical hacker has the responsability to detect those explots made because of bugs or code errors, 
patching 'em. I like CTF games, that's where I can develop and think more patiently to solve a problem with logic and calm. Still in process to win some ones. Because of this, these topics are fundamental into my career, what I'm still studying:
- Networking Environments (OSI Model, WAN, MAN...)
- OSCP, OSCE, eCPPT, eCPPTv2, CEH, LPT, GPEN (In every one I'll get a certificate)
- Pentesting, pivoting and tunneling
- Active and transversal Directory
- Bug Bounty
- SET (Social Engineering Toolkit)
- Get deeper with some collabs with OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)
- Privilage Escalation
- Reverse Shell (Linux/Windows)
- Reverse Engineering (Most popular tool is BurpSuite PortSwigger)
- File transfers
- 80, 443 (Burp Response, Apache Exploiting, htaccess and htpasswd, HTTP requests, Parameter fuzzing, Burp Spider)
- SQL Injection
- Port scanning and listening with nmap and ncat 
- Cryptography
- Buffer Overflows

And there's more!, but now, my lab has 3 VM's with Windows XP (no encrypt), 7 (encrypt) and 10 (encrypt) and 1 VM running Kali Linux with GNOME 42.0. (Updated to Dec 25 2022). Also, I store my VM'S
in VMware Workstation Pro and VMware Player for fast tests.
