title: Who Am I?
---

### Yoooo Folks! I'm Luis De León, best known as Yayo or Elyayoveloz (or Celfeercho too). This is my welcome to my page.

I'm from Mexico and I'm currently studying in Tecnológico de Monterrey CEM (Campus Estado de México)
 
I have lots of hobbies, here's a few of 'em:
- Bowling
- Drawing and writing 
- I read a lot
- Often I play FPS games (once I played tryharded and got into some tournaments lol)
- I can compose some basic Heavy Metal riffs
- I like to assemble things like legos or bricks. 
- Learn new languages (Currently I speak spanish, english, 2/3 french and some basic italian and german)
- I love cars and motorsport, so when I was little I used to play with scale cars. Now, I collect 'em. 

### Doesn't complete at all my career but it's important to me and I like helping people to reach out new goals.

And it's important because along my life, I'd some experiences (not either bad or good) which kinda
affected me to make a change throughout my life, not only in my major. This change has been so good where I'm more motivated and especially more disciplined to do all the things I've to do. And 
I think that's a key in a life's person. Only a few people I love had been sharing this with me (not only with words but with actions) and that's why I'm so grateful with 'em. 

Also, I'm gonna add that I have a truly relationship with God, teaching me some awesome things I wasn't expectate at the time, so along the time, I discovered why those things happened to myself, even
knowing that the consenquences can affect positively to me and the people I love. Obviously, this is another point to decide to share some of my time wuth people I love and people who needs some 
help right now. Just it's matter to remember how valious we are to God and to ourselves. 

Because of this, I'm currently with a side project to talk about some life stuff, to talk about things I've been learning nowadays and to help people if they need to. Below I'll share the link 
for you guys to support it. Soon I'll give lectures for everyone, giving 'em some room to forget of all their problems and focus in the present. I believe there's a unique purpose on every person
in this life. The only thing that matters is to find and fulfill it.

### Anyways, I'm studying Computer Engineering, so I love developing things. However, this is what I'm studying and developing right now.
